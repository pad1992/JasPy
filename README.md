Jasmins Data Analysis in Python

## 1. Downloading Python
The current Python version can be downloaded [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
Make sure to check all the options below after installation:
![Make sure to check at least the "Add Python to PATH" option](/docs/images/Python_Install_3-306051a90888db4c7292964617b7ff75.png)

## 2. Python's analoge Umgebung zu MatLab: JupyterLab
Python has a similar programming environment to MatLab, which is divided into individually executable cells, called [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#).
After you have successfully installed Python you can [install JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/installation.html#pip) by typing `pip install jupyterlab` into your Windows PowerShell and hit Enter.

## 3. Run JupyterLab
JupyterLab files are called "Notebooks" because they are organized like handy notebooks.
Open WindowsExplorer and navigate to the location where you want to create your first JupyterLab Notebook File. Then press RIGHT-MOUSE-CLICK+UMSCHALT at the same time to open the Windows PowerShell in the current directory. You will only see the option in the menu if you really press the right-mouse-click and the UMSCHALT button at the same time, otherwise this option won't appear in the menu:

Then [start JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/starting.html) by typing `jupyter lab` and hit Enter.
Congratulations! You have started the JupyterLab Programming Environment for the first time.

## 4. Run the sample Notebook
Download the (Sample Notebook)[Sample_Notebook.ipynb] and the associated (sample data file)[sample.123] into your JupyterLab working directory, refresh the file browser and open the Sample Notebook in your JupyterLab environment:

There you will a minimal example of how to read in a text file and visualize the data in a plot.
Have fun, I hope it will be helpful =)
